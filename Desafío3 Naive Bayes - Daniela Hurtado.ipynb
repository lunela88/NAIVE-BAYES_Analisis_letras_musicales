    "* En esta sesión trabajaremos con una serie de base de datos sobre letras musicales de distintos artistas. Cada uno de los csv se encuentra en la carpeta dump dentro del proyecto.\n",
    "* Cada csv tiene el nombre del artista a analizar. Los archivos contienen el nombre del artista, el género musical del artista, el nombre de la canción y las letras.\n",
    "* En base a esta información, se les pide un modelo generativo que pueda predecir el género de una canción a patir de la letra de una canción.\n",
    "* Existen 4 géneros que se registran en la base de datos, por lo que para esta actividad trabajaremos con un Multinomial Naive Bayes.\n",

    "* Importe los módulos numpy , pandas , matplotlib , seaborn , glob y os siguiendo las buenas prácticas. Los últimos dos módulos permitirán realizar la importación de múltiples archivos dentro de la carpeta dump .\n",
    "* Para ello genere un objeto que guarde en una lista todos los archivos alojados en dump utilizando glob.glob y os.getcwd() para extraer las rutas absolutas. Posteriormente genere un objeto pd.DataFrame que contenga todos los csv.\n",
    "* Asegúrese de eliminar la columna Unnamed: 0 que se genera por defecto."
